🚨 Apple's Walled Garden is Opening in Japan 🇯🇵

iOS 26.2 Beta 1 just dropped, and it's a game-changer for Japanese iPhone users. For the first time outside the EU, Apple is enabling third-party app stores on iOS.

This isn't voluntary—it's regulatory compliance. Japan's Mobile Software Competition Act takes effect December 18, 2025, and Apple is adapting ahead of the deadline.

What this means:
✅ Alternative app stores like AltStore PAL and Epic Games Store
✅ Developer choice in payment systems  
✅ Breaking the 15-30% App Store commission lock

Expected release: December 9-16, just before the enforcement deadline.

The shift from EU-only to Japan signals a trend: more countries are demanding platform openness. Apple's ecosystem dominance is facing coordinated regulatory pressure worldwide.

For developers: New distribution channels mean new strategies. For users: More choice, potentially lower prices.

The mobile app economy is evolving. Are you ready?
