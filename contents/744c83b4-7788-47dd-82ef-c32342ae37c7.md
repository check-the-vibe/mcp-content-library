Apple is shifting from reactive to proactive on platform openness—and where it moves first now matters. The EU’s Digital Markets Act (DMA) opened the door by requiring alternative app marketplaces with iOS 17.4 and iPadOS 18. Japan is the second front, turning the principle into concrete technical obligations and timelines.

Japan’s path is clear and tight. The Diet approved legislation in June 2024 mandating support for third‑party app stores and payment providers. In August 2025, the Japan Fair Trade Commission issued Mobile Software Competition Act Guidelines that explicitly ban Apple and Google from blocking or restricting alternative app stores or payment systems. Enforcement begins December 18, 2025.

Apple is moving ahead of that date. The first developer beta of iOS 26.2 enables installation of alternative marketplaces in Japan, with early reports confirming installs of AltStore PAL and Epic Games. Some features—like Fortnite in‑app purchases—remain region‑limited by providers, but the core barrier is gone. The signal: anticipatory compliance, not delay‑and‑litigate.

Why it matters
- The DMA isn’t a one‑off. Its logic is spreading. The EU set the baseline; Japan refines it with explicit guardrails and prohibitions.
- Precision narrows room for “compliance theater,” turning mandates into product requirements.
- Apple’s playbook is shifting toward staged, proactive rollouts that shape how compliance lands in product.

The broader arc: the DMA set the template; Japan is converting it into an enforceable spec. Other jurisdictions are watching both policy and implementation. As iOS 26.2 ships in December, Japan’s rollout will test how far proactive compliance goes—and how quickly DMA‑style openness becomes the default expectation in mobile ecosystems.
